# Automation

**Automation** is an intelligent water quality control system that automatically monitors and adjusts key environmental parameters using machine learning.

## 🧠 Objective

To provide a stable and optimized aquatic environment—especially in aquaculture and water treatment settings—by automating the regulation of multiple water quality indicators.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Real-Time Sensor Monitoring**
  - Turbidity
  - Temperature
  - pH (Acidity)
  - Water Level
  - TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)
  - Ammonia (NH₃/NH₄⁺)
  - Nitrate (NO₃⁻)
  - Nitrite (NO₂⁻)
  - TAN (Total Ammonia Nitrogen)
  - Dissolved Oxygen (DO, varies by fish species)

- **Machine Learning-Based Control**
  - Anomaly detection and prediction based on sensor data
  - Automated control of pumps, aeration systems, chemical dosing, etc.
  - Adaptive to different aquatic species and environmental requirements

- **User Dashboard (Planned)**
  - Real-time monitoring interface
  - Alerts and system logs


## 📈 Use Cases

- Smart aquaculture systems
- Water treatment plants
- Environmental research labs
- Fully automated fish farms
